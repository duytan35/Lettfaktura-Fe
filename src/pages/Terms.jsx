          BY clicking Invoice Now, you choose to register according to the
          information that you have typed in and the text on the registration
          page and the terms here, and you at the same time accept the terms
          here.

        <p>
          You can use Invoice Now free for a trial program from FDR FREE for 14
          days.
        </p>

        <p>
          123 Fakturera is so easy and self-explanatory so hopefully the chance
          that you will need support is minimal, but if you should need support,
          we are there for you, with our office manned for the most part of the
          day. After the trial period, the subscription continues and costs SEK
          99 excluding VAT per month, which is billed annually. If you do not
          want to keep using the program, just cancel the trial period by giving
          notice before 14 days from registration.
        </p>

        <p>
          You have of course the right to terminate the use of the program
          without any costs, by giving us notice per email before 14 days from
          registration, that you do not want to continue with the program, and
          you then of course do not pay anything.
        </p>

        <p>
          If we do not receive such a notice from you before 14 days from
          registration, the order, for natural reasons, cannot be changed. With
          registration it is meant the date and time when you choose to press
          the button Invoice Now.
